# Contributing

Follow these steps to be proper. There is a lot of very specific steps and automations, please read this entire document before starting. Many questions will be answered by simply getting everything setup exactly the same way in the instructions.

## Changelog

Make sure to take note of your changes in the changelog. This is done by updating the `CHANGELOG.md` file. Add any new details under the `## [Unreleased]` section. When a new version is published, the word `Unreleased` will be replaced with the version number and the date. The section will also be the detailed release notes under releases in Github. The checks on the PR will fail if you don't add any notes in the changelog.

See the [`version.py`](./scripts/version.py) script for more details on how the version command will inject the new version into the changelog by resetting the `Unreleased` section.

## Signed Commits

This is a public repo, one cannot simply trust that a commit came from who it says it did. To ensure the integrity of the commits, all commits must be signed. Your commits and PR will be rejected if they are not signed. Please read more about how to do this here if you do not know how: [Github Signing Commits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits). Ideally, if you have 1password, please follow these instructions: [1Password Signing Commits](https://blog.1password.com/git-commit-signing/).
